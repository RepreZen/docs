In {%link cg_intro%} we discuss GenTemplates and GenTargets in the context of RAPID-ML models. But
as you may know, {RAS} is a great platform for working with API specifications in Swagger, now 
officially the link:https://openapis.org[OpenAPI Specification^]. This includes full access to the
link:https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen[Swagger Codegen^] framework.

If you've used Swagger Codegen (SCG), you'll know that the implementation comes with several
out-of-the-box modules that generate documentation, client libraries for a variety of languages, and
service scaffolding, also geared toward a variety of languages and underlying frameworks. You'll be
glad to know that all of these standard SCG modules are available as GenTemplates in {RAS}.

== Model Type Determines GenTemplates
As the following screenshots demonstrate, the list of available GenTemplates shown in the New
GenTarget wizard depends on the type of the selected model file - Swagger or RAPID-ML.

== Swagger Codegen Parameters

The GenTarget (`.gen`) files that define GenTargets in a model project are YAML files that, among
other things, provide values for parameters that may be used by the GenTemplate. In general, a
GenTemplate declares its parameters including the following information for each parameter:

Name:: The name of the parameter
Description:: A description of how the parameter will be used
Required:: True or false, depending on whether the GenTarget is required to supply a value for the
parameter
Default:: A default value for the parameter, which is copied into the GenTarget file by the New
GenTarget wizard

In the Swagger Codegen framework, SCG modules can declare _options_ which are analagous to
GenTemplate parameters, but without _required_ and _default_ properties. The GenTemplates offered by
{RAS} for SCG modules automatically define an optional parameter with no default value for each
option declared by the SCG module. For example, here is a portion of a GenTarget based on the _Java_
SCG GenTarget. You can edit this file to provide values for any of the listed parameters.

There are two additional parameters that are available with every SCG GenTemplate, as shown below:

The `swaggerCodegenConfig` parameter is a convenience option; when a complete config file is already
available for the SCG module -- as it might be if the same module had been used outside {RAS} --
that file can simply be copied into the `.gen` file as the value of this parameter. However, the
same effect could be achieved by copying values to individual parameters in the `.gen` file.

The `swaggerCodegenSystemProperties` parameter sets Java system properties that may affect the way
the SCG module operates. These are properties that would be set using the `-D` option using the
Swagger Codegen command line interface.

Unused parameters appearing in the wizard-created `.gen` file can be deleted to reduce clutter:
because SCG lacks the ability to declare options as required or optional, all parameters in a
corresponding GenTarget are, by definition, optional.

== Support for Additional SCG Modules

{RAS} comes prepackaged with all of the standard SCG modules available as GenTargets, but you can
also make use of non-standard modules that {%linkx cg_customSCG%}[you create yourself] or that you
obtain from other sources. In {%link cg_share%} we describe the ways you can make a GenTemplate
available for models in your workspace, namely:

* Placing a Java jar file containing the GenTemplate implementation in a model project's `lib`
  folder
* Placing the jar file in your workspace's shared GenTemplates folder
* Importing a Java project that implements the GenTemplate into your workspace from a variety of
  sources, including GitHub

The good news for SCG users is that the same mechanisms all work for non-standard SCG modules as
well. As long as your module is properly configured to be discoverable by the SCG command line
tool,footnote:[Swagger Codegen uses Java's `ServiceManager` class to discover available SCG
modules. For a module to be discoverable, the fully-qualified class name of the implementing class
must appear on a line by itself in a text resource named
[nowrap]#`META-INF/services/io.swagger.codegen.CodegenConfig`#. This resource is typically packaged
as part of any SCG module.] it will also be discoverable by {RAS}, which will automatically, upon
discovery, wrap it into a GenTemplate.
