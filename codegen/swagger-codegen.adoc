In {%link cg_intro%} we discuss GenTemplates and GenTargets in the context of RAPID-ML models. But
as you may know, {RAS} is a great platform for working with Swagger -- a.k.a. OpenAPI -- API
specifications. This includes full access to the
link:https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen[Swagger Codegen] framework.

If you've used Swagger Codegen (SCG), you'll know that the implementation comes with several
out-of-the-box modules that generate documentation, client libraries for a variety of languages, and
service scaffolding, also geared toward a variety of languages and underlying frameworks. You'll be
glad to know that all of these standard SCG modules are available as GenTemplates in {RAS}.

== Model Type Determines GenTemplates
As the following screenshots demonstrate, the list of available GenTemplates shown in the New
GenTarget wizard depends on the type of the selected model file - Swagger or RAPID-ML.

== Swagger Codegen Parameters

The GenTarget (`.gen`) files that define GenTargets in a model project are JSON files that, among
other things, provide values for parameters that may be used by the GenTemplate. In general, a
GenTemplate declares its parameters including the following information for each parameter:

Name:: The name of the parameter
Description:: A description of how the parameter will be used
Required:: True or false, depending on whether the GenTarget is required to supply a value for the
parameter
Default:: A default value for the parameter, which is copied into the GenTarget file by the New
GenTarget wizard

In the Swagger Codegen framework, SCG modules can declare _options_ which are analagous to
GenTemplate parameters, but without _required_ and _default_ properties. The GenTemplates offered by
{RAS} for SCG modules automatically define an optional parameter with no default value for each
option declared by the SCG module. For example, here is a portion of a GenTarget based on the _Java_
SCG GenTarget. You can edit this file to provide values for any of the listed parameters.

There are two additional parameters that are available with every SCG GenTempalte, as shown below:

The `swaggerCodegenConfig` parameter is a convenience option when a complete config file is already
available for the SCG module, as it might be if the same module had been used outside {RAS}, that
file can simply be copied into the `.gen` file as the value of this parameter. However, the same
parameters could be specified as individual parameters.

The `swaggerCodegenSystemProperties` parameter sets Java system properties that may affect the way
the SCG module operates. These are properties that would be set using the `-D` option using the
Swagger Codegen command line interface.
