When you create a custom GenTemplate, you may wish to share it with others -- team members,
customers, etc. This is easy to do with {RAS}. Currently, you can share GenTemplates by packaging
them as jar files, or you can share your GenTemplate projects in external repositories like
GitHub.

In the future we intend to make it possible to use GenTemplates published to Maven repositories.

== Sharing Jar Files

One way to share a GenTemplate is to package it as a Java jar file and then share that jar file.

To create a jar file, right click on the GenTemplate project folder in the Project Explorer pane,
and select _Run As -> Maven build..._:

In the dialog that appears, type `package` in the _Goals_ field, and press _Run_.

TIP: If you are familiar with using Eclipse for Java development, you may wish to switch to the
_Java_ perspective while working on GenTemplate projects. One benefit is that the standard _Run_
tool will be present in the toolbar, making it easy to re-run this packaging step at any time.

{RAS} will create a jar file in your project's `target` folder:

TIP: If you are unable to open your `target` folder, try refreshing it by typing _F5_ when the
folder is selected.

You can now copy the new jar file and paste a copy anywhere you'd like, either within the {RAS}
Project Explorer or in your system's file explorer. You can also use drag-and-drop to copy the jar
file, and there are many applications that can serve as drop targets, including many email
applications, cloud storage solutions like Google Drive and Dropbox, and so on.

== Using Packaged GenTemplates

If you create or obtain a GenTemplate packaged as a Jar file and you want to use to create
GenTargets in your model projects, you have two simple options:

1. Copy the jar file into your model project's `lib` folder.
2. Copy the jar file into a the `GenTemplates` folder in a project named `shared` in your {RAS} workspace.

The first option makes the GenTemplates in the jar file available for use with all the models in
that model project, but not models in other projects. The second option makes those GenTemplates
available in all your model projects.

Either way, you'll need to create the indicated project and/or folder if they don't already exist.

TIP: If you need to create a `shared` project, select _File -> New -> Project_ in the menu bar, then
choose _General -> Project_ in the New Project dialog.

With your jar file in either location, {RAS} will find any GenTemplates it contains, and you will
find those GenTemplates available for use.

TIP: You can change the location of the shared folder in the RepreZen preferences. Select _Window ->
Preferences_ in the menu bar, and then navigate to _RepreZen -> Code Generation_ and enter your
desired path. If you start your path with `${workspace_loc}`, as with the factory default, your path
will be resolved within your {RAS} workspace. But you can leave that off and specify a path anywhere
in your system.
