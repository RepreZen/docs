= Creating a Custom Swagger GenTemplate

:RZ: RepreZen

In {%link codegen_intro%} we walked through a scenario that included the creation of a custom
GenTemplate using the _New GenTemplate_ wizard. From a fully working "starter" implementation, we
modified an Xtend template that formed the basis of the implementation, and we altered the output
file extension configured for the GenTemplate from `.html` to `.csv`. In the end we had created a
GenTemplate that captures model information in a CSV format.

In that exercise, the GenTemplate was designed to operate on RAPID-ML models. The exact same
approach can be used to create Xtext-based GenTemplates that operate on Swagger models. The starter
implementation will differ in certain ways -- most evidently in the Xtext template itself, which
will reflect the
link:https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/tree/master/modules/swagger-models[Swagger Models
API] rather than the RAPID-ML Model API.

== Using the Swagger Codegen Framework

Another option, for those familiar with the
link:https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen[Swagger Codegen] framework, is to build a custom
Swagger Codegen (SCG) module in a Java project within the {RAS} workspace. Any such module will
automatically be discovered and "wrapped" as a GenTemplate by {RAS}, and you can apply them to your
Swagger models by creating GenTargets.

The steps for creating a custom SCG module, detailed below, are:

1. Use the SCG command line interface to create a skeleton for your new module.
2. Import that skeleton into {RAS} as a new Java project.
3. Modify the skeleton Java code and Mustache templates to suit your needs.
4. See that your new module is now listed with the standard SCG modules in the New GenTemplate
wizard.

We will, in the course of describing these steps in detail, work through an example that will mimic
the `LexiconGenTemplates` custom GenTemplate created in {%link cg_intro#createGenTemplate%}. Please
review that document to learn the motivating hypothetical scenario.

NOTE: Some of the details in this section apply to version 2.1.4 of SCG, and include information
from available documentation and also from code inspection. {RAS} currently uses release 2.1.4 but
will soon migrate to release 2.1.5. At that time we will update this document as needed.

=== Creating the SCG Skeleton

The SCG Command Line interface (CLI) includes a command, `meta`, which can be used to create the
skeleton for a new SCG module. The CLI is embedded in the Java command line, with the SCG
executable jar file and the class that implements the selected SCG module as command-line
arguments.footnote:[Although SCG is published with several convenience scripts that invoke the CLI on
specific sample models embedded in the project, it does not provide a general-purpose script to
invoke the CLI. Such a script would be simple to create, but in this guide we will show the full
Java command lines.]

Our first step invokes the SCG `meta` command to create a skeleton project. The command arguments we
will use are:

`-o dir`:: Specifies the directory where the skeleton project will be created; default is the current
directory.

`-n name`:: Specifies the name for the new SCG module, which is put to many uses in the skeleton,
some of which imply restrictions on the name that are not enforced by SCG. These
include:

** It is the advertised name of the module (i.e. the value its `CodegenConfig#getName()` method
   returns). The CLI `generate` command's `-l` (`--lang`) option maps to these names.
** It is incorporated into the name of the generator class, which is the name value with its first
   character upper-cased, concatenated with `Generator`. E.g. `-n myModule` would generate a class
   named `MyModuleGenerator`.
** It is incorporated into the advertised description of the model (the value returned by
   `CodegenConfig#getHelp()`).
** It is incorporated into the name of the default output folder used by the module. (This is
   unused when the module is executed in {RAS} as a GenTemplate, since the output directory is in
   that case specified in the GenTarget.)
** It is used as the template directory name. This directory will appear as a top-level Java
   resource directory in the generated project.

`-p package`:: Specifies the package in which the generator class will reside. The default is
`io.swagger.codegen`.

In preparation for this step we need to install the Swagger Codegen Client jar file. One way to do
that is to clone the link:https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen[swagger-api/swagger-codegen
git repo], checking out version 2.1.4 (using the git tag `v2.1.4`) and then running `mvn package`
from the working tree root. This will build the needed jar file in
[.nowrap]`modules/swagger-codegen-cli/target/swagger-codegen-cli.jar`.

To execute this step we'll need to launch a command shell for our system. For simplicity, we'll
specify paths relative to our home directory using the linux `~` designator. Modify the paths in
your command as needed, depending on where your `swagger-codegen` git clone is located, and where
you want the skeleton to be created.

After all the foregoing, this step finally comes down to a single command, which will create our
skeleton:

[source%nowrap]
--
java -jar ~/git/swagger-codegen/modules/swagger-codegen-cli/target/swagger-codegen-cli.jar meta -o ~/LexiconSCGentemplates -n lexiconSCGenTemplate -p my.org
--

=== Importing the Skeleton into {RAS}

The skeleton is configured as a Maven project, and {RAS} includes the capability of importing Maven
projects into the workspace. From the menu bar, select _File -> Import..._, then select _Maven ->
Existing Maven Projects_ in the dialog that appears. Click _Next_.

image::import-maven-step-1.png[Import Skeleton Project Step 1,role=text-center]

Browse to the output folder you specified for the SCG `meta` command, and you should see the Maven
`pom.xml` file for the skeleton in the projects list. With that entry checked, click _Next_.

image::import-maven-step-2.png[Import Skeleton Project Step 2,role=text-center]

Click _Finish_ on the final panel, and {RAS} will complete the import and immediately build the new
project.

image::import-maven-step-3.png[Import Skeleton Project Step 3,role=text-center]

At this point your skeleton is complete, but not quite functional. The problem is that the Java
class that implements your new generator configures a "supporting" template to run on your model,
but the skeleton does not actually include the needed template file. You can fix this by removing or
commenting out the problematic java code. In the following image we show the code commented out.

image::fixed-skeleton.png[Fixed Skeleton Class,role=text-center]

With this change, your custom module is completely functional, if not very useful. Go ahead and try
executing it with a Swagger model of your choice, by creating and running a GenTarget.

=== Modifying the Skeleton

Now we'll modify our skeleton project so that it generates a CSV file listing all the operations
defined by the Swagger model.

We won't be creating any API or model files, for which the skeleton makes special provision, so
we'll comment out the lines that declare the corresponding templates. You can delete these lines,
but we'll comment them out to make our screen shots understandable.

image::skeleton-comment-standard-templates.png[Suppress Standard Templates,role=text-center]

Next we'll uncomment that code we commented out earlier, becuase a "supporting" template is a good
choice for our CSV file generator. After reviving that code, we'll change the template and output
file names to choices that are appropriate for our task.

image::skeleton-change-output-file.png[Change Template Output File,role=text-center]

Next, we'll create a new Mustache template file in the `resources` source tree. Again, you could
also delete the existing templates, but we'll leave them in place.

image::skeleton-create-lexicon-template.png[Create Lexicon Template File,role=text-center]

Finally, we'll enter code into the new template file so as to produce our desired output. We will
not go into any details of the Mustache templating language, or the structure in which the Swagger
model is presented to the template by the Swagger Codegen framework. You can read about Mustache
link:https://mustache.github.io/[here].

The structures passed to the Mustache templates do not appear to be documented, and they differ
considerably from both the structure of a Swagger Spec and from that presented by the
link:https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/tree/master/modules/swagger-models[Swagger Models]
Java API. To get some insight into the structure, one helpful resource is the console output created
when an SCG module is executed with the `debugModels`, `debugOperations`, and `debugSupportingFiles`
Java system properties set. The output shows the precise JSON structure on which the model, api, and
supporting templates, respectively, will operate.footnote:[Recall that in {RAS} you can arrange for
system properties to be set when executing an SCG-based GenTemplate by providing a value for the
`swaggerCodegenSystemProperties` parameter in the GenTarget file.]

Here is our final template:

[source%nowrap,mustache]
--
Name,Type,Parent,ParentType,Model,Documentation
{% raw %}{{appName}},Model,,,{{appName}},{{appDescription}}
{{#apiInfo}}{{#apis}}{{#operations}}{{#operation
}}{{nickname}},Operation,{{appName}},Model,{{summary}}
{{/operation}}{{/operations}}{{/apis}}{{/apiInfo}}{% endraw %}
--

Note that this template looks particularly cramped compared to most that you'll see in SCG
modules. The reason is the care that we must take to avoid unintended whitespace from appearing in
our output, including blank lines. We had some similar difficulties in the Xtend template we created
in {%link cg_intro#createGenTemplate%}. This focus on whitespace reflects an unusual requirement of
our hypothetical use-case.

=== Using Your New SCG Module

If you've carefully followed the steps in this guide, you should now have a fully operational custom
SCG module, and you should see it listed as an available GenTemplate in the New GenTarget wizard.

Applying this new GenTemplate to the _PetStore_ model (available from the {RAS} Examples Wizard)
yields the following output:

[source%nowrap,csv]
--
Name,Type,Parent,ParentType,Model,Documentation
Swagger Petstore,Model,,,Swagger Petstore,
listPets,Operation,Swagger Petstore,Model,List all pets
createPets,Operation,Swagger Petstore,Model,Create a pet
showPetById,Operation,Swagger Petstore,Model,Info for a specific pet
