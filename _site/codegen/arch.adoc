== The Generator Architecture

This figure shows the main parts of the {RAS} code generation framework.

Components in this framework include:

GenEngine :: A GenEngine encompasses facilities built into {RAS} to support a specific code
generation technology, such as a templating engine. {RAS} currently comes with a single GenEngine,
which supports the http://xtend-lang.org[Xtend,window=_blank] templating language.footnote:[Note
that the Xtend language is very nearly a superset of Java, so if you are a Java programmer you can
use most of what you know in your Xtend classes. And you can intermingle pure Java classes at will,
and use all available Java libraries with without any compatibility issues. This is guaranteed by
the fact that Xtend classes are not actually compiled, but are rather transformed into pure Java
classes, which are then compiled by the Java compiler.]
+
GenEngines are not currently implemented in a way that makes it feasible for end users to create
their own. We hope to provide GenEngines for other popular generation tools in the future.

GenTemplate :: A GenTemplate is an implementation of a code generator using a particular
GenEngine. Each GenTemplate produces output for a specific purpose, in a form suited to that
purpose. The generators that are built into {RAS} are all GenTemplates built using the Xtend
GenEngine.footnote:[Building on the footnote regarding Xtend in the context of GenEngine, we can
further point out that it is perfectly possible to code an Xtend GenTemplate completely in
Java. Indeed, some of the GenTemplates built into {RAS} are pure Java.]

GenTarget :: A GenTarget applies a GenTemplate to a model. When you create a GenTarget, it becomes
part of the model project.
+
Executing a GenTarget causes the associated GenTemplate to be executed against the associated model,
with the results appearing as files in the model project, in a folder specified by the GenTarget.

As stated earlier, {RAS} comes with numerous built-in generators. We can now state that with a bit
more precision: {RAS} comes with a number of built-in GenTemplates, each based on the Xtend
GenEngine. Likewise, when we stated that developers could create their own customized generators,
that really meant that developers can easily create and use their own GenTemplates, also based on
the Xtend GenEngine.
