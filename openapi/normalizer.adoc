KaiZen OpenAPI Normalizer (formerly known as Swagger Normalizer) is a core component of the OpenAPI
Multi-File Support in {RAS}, and as such it is used by each of the three "`live`" views -
Documentation View, Diagram View, and Swagger UI View - that appear by default in the right-hand
pane of the {RAS} GUI, as well as by all Swagger and OpenAPI v3 GenTemplates. You can also use it
directly as its own GenTemplate, named "`KaiZen OpenAPI Normalizer [YAML+JSON]`" in the GenTarget
Wizard.

The primary function of the normalizer is to render a multi-file OpenAPI model spec as a
functionally equivalent single-file spec. In this way it can simplify the use of other tools and
libraries in the evolving OpenAPI ecosystem, where external references are not always handled
consistently.

Additionally, the normalizer can perform other transformations of the OpenAPI spec, which may be
helpful for some circumstances, especially when feeding the spec to downstream systems.

Note: The term "Swagger" is a trademark of Smartbear Software and is the prior of some versions of
the OpenAPI specification. In particular, "Swagger" is still commonly used to refer to version 2.0
of the https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification[{OAS}]. In this document we will
refer to this as "OpenAPI v2" wherever we need to refer specifically to that version of the
specificaiton.

== Basic Use

The Normalizer is used like any other OpenAPI GenTemplate:

1. Create a GenTarget (a `.gen` file) in your model folder, linking your OpenAPI model file (`.yaml`
file) to the GenTemplate. The internal id of this GenTemplate is: footnote:[Note that the internal
id reflects the fact that the normalizer was initially developed prior to the creation of the
https://www.openapis.org/[OpenAPI Initiative], and we have retained the original id for backward
compatibility.]
+
[source%nowrap]
--
com.modelsolv.reprezen.gentemplates.swaggernorm.SwaggerNormalizerGenTemplate
--
+
The name listed in the drop-down list in the GenTarget wizard is
"`KaiZen OpenAPI Normalizer [YAML+JSON].`" footnote:[Note that the internal id reflects the fact that
the normalizer was initially developed prior to the creation of the
https://www.openapis.org/[OpenAPI Initiative], and we have retained the original id for backward compatibility.]

2. Configure the GenTarget as desired (see below).

3. Execute the GenTarget

4. Find the generated YAML file in the `generated` folder that appears
in the GenTarget folder.

// Should have images walking through this process

== Multifile Processing

The one thing that the normalizer will always do is resolve external references and leave you with a
single-file OpenAPI Spec. The other things it may do depend on options, described in
// prevent line breaking section name
<<Normalizer Options>>.

=== References in OpenAPI Specs

Here's an example of what a typical _reference_ might look like in a OpenAPI spec:

```
responses:
  default:
    description: Default Response
    content:
      application/json:
        schema:
          $ref: "#/components/schemas/Pet"
```

This is part of the definition of an operation whose normal response will contain data about
a pet. That information will be structured according to a schema named `Pet` defined elsewhere in
this same OpenAPI spec, in the `components/schemas` section of the spec.

The reference itself appears as the value of the `schema` property in the the response
content map. That property could appear with an "in-line" schema definition, but in this case the
designer has opted to define the schema elsewhere in the file and reference it here by name. The
reference itself takes the form of an object with a string-valued property named
`$ref`. footnote:[Local references like this one - that is references to an object in the same
file - always start with a pound sign: "#". This happens to be the comment character in YAML syntax,
so a common error is to omit quotes around the reference string. This will have the same effect as
an empty string, which can lead to a variety of problems with consumers of the model. Be careful to
always use quotes around your reference strings!]

If the definition of the `Pet` schema physically appeared in some other model spec, the reference
would need to include a URL to retrieve that spec, with a fragment identical to the reference string
shown above:

```
responses:
  default:
    description: Default Response
    content:
      application/json:
        schema:
          $ref: "http://models.example.com/petstore-schemas.yaml#/components/schemas/Pet"
```


TIP: OpenAPI's `$ref` syntax conforms to a separate standard known as "JSON Reference." That
standard is available https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-pbryan-zyp-json-ref-03[here^].

==== Conforming and Non-Conforming References

References in an OpenAPI spec should all be of the variety specifically endorsed by the {OAS}. We'll
call those _conforming references_. All other references will be called _non-conforming
references_.

The precise definition differs between v2 and v3 of the specification, but in both cases, the
definition depends on prefixes of the fragment portion of the reference string.

|===
| v2 Conforming Prefixes 2+| v3 Conforming Prefixes
a|
* `#/paths/`
* `#/parameters/`
* `#/responses/`
* `#/definitions/`
a|
* `#/paths/`
* `#/components/schemas/`
* `#/components/responses/`
* `#/components/parameters/`
* `#/components/examples/`
a|
* `#/components/requestBodies/`
* `#/components/headers/`
* `#/components/securitySchemes/`
* `#/components/links/`
* `#/components/callbacks/`
|===

Normalizer does not treat conforming and non-conforming reference identically.


=== What the Normalizer Does with References

When the normalizer encounters any reference, there are two ways it may process the reference:

Inline:: The normalizer retrieves the referenced value (e.g. the `Pet` schema definition object) and
replaces the reference itself with that value.

Localize:: The normalizer first adds the referenced object to the normalized spec that it is
creating, if it is not already present, and then replaces the reference with a local reference to
that object. So in the external reference example shown above, the `Pet` schema definition would
appear directly in the OpenAPI spec produced by the normalizer, and references that were formerly
external references would become local references.

The normalizer _always_ inlines non-conforming references. Any given conforming reference might be
inlined or localized, depending on
// 
<<Normalizer Options,options>> in effect.

==== Name Collisions

Localization of a conforming reference may lead to a name collision. For example, imagine the
following excerpts from two OpenAPI specs:

[source%nowrap]
.main.yaml
----
components:
  schemas:
    Address:
      description: An address given by a speaker
      type: object
      properties:
        speaker:
           $ref: "external.yaml#/components/schemas/Person"
        title:
          type: string
      ...
----

[source%nowrap]
.external.yaml
----
components:
  schemas:
    Person:
      name:
         type: string
      address:
        $ref: "#/components/schemas/Address"
    Address:
      description: A postal address
      type: object
      properties:
        street:
          type: string
      ...
----

The main spec is apparently describing APIs related to events where speakers deliver addresses. The
speakers themselves are represented using an externally referenced `Person` schema which itself
makes use of a locally referenced `Address` schema.

In a localizing scenario, the normalized spec created by the normalizer would look something like
this:

[source%nowrap]
.main-normalized.yaml
----
components:
  schemas:
    Address:
      description: An address given by a speaker
      type: object
      properties:
        speaker:
           $ref: "#/components/schemas/Person"   <1>
        title:
          type: string
      ...
    Person:
      name:
         type: string
      address:
        $ref: "#/components/schemas/Address_1"   <2>
    Address_1:
      description: A postal address
      type: object
      properties:
        street:
          type: string
      ...
----

The two `Address` schemas originally in _main.yaml_ and _external.yaml_ are both needed in the
normalized spec, but their names collide. Therefore, the schema definition originally in
_external.yaml_ is renamed to `Address_1`.

All references have been adjusted as required:

<1> The former external reference to the `Person` schema is now a local reference.

<2> The `Person` schema's `Address` reference now reflects the renaming that occurred.

Renaming is done only where necessary due to a conflict, and the names appearing in the top-level
spec are always preserved as-is; that is, if there is a colliding externally referenced object that
needs to be localized, that object will be renamed, not the top-level object with which it
collided. In the above example, the `Address` schema occurring in _main.yaml_ will always retain its
original name, forcing any colliding objects to be renamed.

==== Recursive References

It is possible to set up recursive schema definitions in OpenAPI specs, through the use of
references. For example, consider the following schema:

```
components:
  schemas:
    Person:
      type: object
      properties:
        name:
          type: string
        children:
           $ref: "#/components/schemas/People"  <1>
    People:
      type: array
      items:
        $ref: "#/components/schemas/Person"     <2>
```

<1> The `Person` schema has a `children` property of type `People`,
and

<2> the `People` schema defines an array of `Person` objects.

Naively attempting to inline a reference to a `Person` object would
lead to a never-ending expansion like this:

[source%nowrap]
.original
----
matriarch:
  $ref: "#/components/schemas/Person"
----

[source%nowrap]
.inlined
----
matriarch:
  type: object                 # inline Person
  properties:
    name:
      type: string
    children:
      type: array              # inline People
      items:
        type: object           # inline Person
        properties:
          name:
            type: string
          children:
            type: array        # inline People
            items:
               type: object    # inline Person
               ...             # inlining never ends
----

We have cut off the inlining above with an ellipsis, but in reality it could never stop.

To handle recursive references encountered during inlining, the normalizer stops inlining whenever a
reference is encountered that is fully contained within another (inlined) instance of the referenced
object. That recursive reference is localized rather than being inlined.

In the above example, we would end up with something like this:

[source%nowrap]
.partially-inlined
----
    matriarch:
      type: object                                      <1>
      properties:
	name:
	  type: string
	children:
	  type: array
	  items:
	    $ref: "#/components/schemas/Person"        <2>
...
components:
  schemas:
    Person:
      type: object
      properties:
        name:
          type: string
        children:
          type: array
          items:
            $ref: "#/components/schemas/Person"        <3>
...
----

Here we see:

<1> that the top-level reference to `Person` as the type of the `matriarch` property was inlined;

<2> that the recursive reference to `Person` encountered while performing this inlining has been
localized;

<3> that the `Person` schema itself was subjected to inlining, with localization of its recursive
reference;

Note that the `People` schema never ran into a recursive reference during inlining (though that
could have happened, e.g. if `matriarch` had a `parents` property of type `People`). Therefore it
was not localized.

When an object is inlined without encountering a recursive reference (so that the object is not also
localized), we say that it is _fully inlined_. This was the case for `People` above.

WARNING: For non-conforming references, recursion is not currently permitted and will cause the
normalizer to fail.

== Object Retention

Some of the normalizer options pertain to _object retention policy_: rules that decide which objects
from the multifile spec will appear in the normalized output.

=== The Completeness Rule

In all cases, the normalized spec must be _complete_, in the sense that all references appearing in
the spec resolve to objects defined in the spec.footnote:[The only exception to this is references
that could not be resolved in the original spec; these will be copied as-is into the normalized
spec.] Thus, any object that is referenced in the normalized spec is also retained in the normalized
spec.

Objects that are _fully inlined_ are not required by the completeness rule and may not be retained,
depending on options in effect. An object that is _partially inlined_ because of recursive
references _is_ required by completeness, since recursive references are localized. Such an object
must be retained.

All other retention policy is subordinate to completeness: every referenced object is retained, even
if other retention policy would cause it to be dropped.

=== Root Objects

Completeness presupposes a starting point: some set of objects that are retained for other
reasons. References appearing in those objects are processed for completeness, and then objects that
are retained for completeness are themselves processed for completeness, and so on.

We call the objects that are retained for reasons other than completeness _root objects_. Root
objects are determined according to _retention policy_ and _retention scope_, as defined by
//
<<Normalizer Options,options>>.

==== Retention Policy

Retention policy is determined according to RETAIN and DROP rules that select and reject individual
objects. An object is retained if it matches at least one RETAIN rule and does not match any DROP
rule.

Currently, there is only one RETAIN rule, which specifies which object types - paths, schemas,
parameters, responses, etc.  - are to be retained. There are not currently any DROP rules
implemented. We anticipate implementing additional RETAIN and DROP rules in the future to provide
additional flexibility.

Object-type-based retention policy is specified with the *RETAIN* option.

=== Retention Scope

Retention policy is applied only to objects that appear in files that are considered _in scope_ for
retention. The top-level file is always in scope.

When processing an OpenAPI spec, other specs may be loaded in order to satisfy references. By
default, those other specs are not in scope. However, if the *RETENTION_SCOPE* option is set to ALL,
specs that are loaded solely to resolve references will also be considered in scope, so that other
objects in those files may be retained - even if they are not needed for completeness.

It is also possible to identify other files to be treated as top-level for retention purposes, by
listing them in the *ADDITIONAL_FILES* option.footnote:[The only difference between these files and
the actual top-level file has to do with object renaming. As stated earlier, objects appearing in
the top-level spec will never be renamed. However, it is possible for a name collision to occur when
loading "additional" files, and such collisions will trigger object renaming. Additional files are
loaded immediately after the top-level file, in the order in which they are specified, and naming
priority always favors the earlier-loaded files.] All such files will be loaded and will be in-scope
for retention, regardless of whether any objects they contain are otherwise required for
completeness. And of course, retained references from those files will be processed for
completeness.

[TIP]
--
One important use-case for "additional files" involves `allOf` schema defintions. These are commonly
used to express type hierarchies, and in such cases it is common for a _supertype_ to be referenced
from the top-level spec (e.g. a list of `Animal` objects). The _subtypes_ themselves also reference
the supertype in their _allOf_ property (e.g. `Dog` and `Cat` both reference `Animal`). However, it
is common for the subtypes themselves _not_ to be directly referenced in the OpenAPI spec; they are
_not_ typically referenced by the supertype itself (`Dog` references `Animal`, but not vice-versa).

If the subtypes are defined in a separate file, that file will not be loaded for reference
resolution, and so those subtypes will not be loaded--let alone retained--by the
normalizer. Configuring the file as an "additional file" would cause the file to be loaded, and
subtype definitions would then be eligible for retention.

== Normalizer Options

When the normalizer is used through its GenTemplate ("KaiZen OpenAPI Normalizer [YAML+JSON]"),
options are configured in the GenTarget file -- the `.gen` file created by the GenTarget
wizard. Each option can take on various values, as detailed below.

Options are as follows:

INLINE :: Specify which objects are inlined by the normalizer. The
value of this option can be:

* A list of non-PATH object types, drawn from the types relevant to the model version.footnote:[PATH
  is not an option because paths are always inlined; local path references are disallowed in OpenAPI
  specs.]
** For v3 models, this includes SCHEMA, RESPONSE, PARAMETER, EXAMPLE, REQUEST_BODY, HEADER,
   SECURITY_SCHEME, LINK, and CALLBACK.

** For v2 models, this includes DEFINITION, PARAMETER, and RESPONSE.

* The value ALL, meaning that all objects are inlined.

* The value COMPONENT, meaning that all objects except paths are inlined.footnote:[This option is
  really equivalent to ALL, since paths are always inlined anyway; no other treatment is sensible
  since local path references are not allowed in an OpneAPI  spec.]

* The value NONE, meaning that no objects (except paths) are inlined.

RETAIN :: Specify which object types will be retained from in-scope files. The value of this option
can be:

* A list of object types relevent to the model type (same as for INLINE, but also including PATH).

* The value ALL, meaning that all objects are retained.

* The value COMPONENT, meaning that all objects except paths are retained.

* The value PATH_OR_COMPONENT footnote:[This option is needed for our Reprezen HTML Documentation
  gen target, which inlines everything by default and retains only top-level paths, except when
  there are no paths; in that case it still inlines everything, but it also retains everything.], meaning
  that:

** If the top-level spec defines at least one path, then the PATH option will be in effect.

** Otherwise, the COMPONENT option will be in effect.

RETENTION_SCOPE :: Determines which OpenAPI model specs are considered in-scope for retention
rules. Value is either:

* ROOTS, meaning that only the top-level file and any files specified in *ADDITIONAL_FILES* will be
  in scope; or

* ALL, meaning that files loaded in order to resolve references will also be considered in scope.

ADDITIONAL_FILES :: Specifies additional files that should be treated as top-level for retention,
and are therefore always loaded and always in-scope. The value is a list of file names, or more
generally URLs. Each URL, if it is relative, is resolved based on the URL that specifies the
top-level file.

=== Swagger-Only Options

The following options currently apply only to Swagger (i.e. OpenAPI v2) model specs. They address
perceived shortcomings in `SwaggerParser` and its associated `Swagger` object model and API.

HOIST :: Enables some or all of the _hoisting_ operations that can be performed by the
normalizer. Hoisting refers to extrapolating certain items appearing in a Swagger spec into the
contexts in which they apply. The option value is a list of hoistable items, drawn from:
+
--
* MEDIA_TYPE: Global `consumes` and `produces` declarations are extrapolated into all operations
  that do not contain their own declarations.

* PARAMETER: Parameters defined at path-level are extrapolated into every operation appearing in the
  path that does not already define a parameter with the same name and the same `in` value.

* SECURITY_REQUIREMENT: The global security requirements array is extrapolated into every operation
  that does not define its own.
--
+
The *HOIST* option value may also be ALL or NONE.

REWRITE_SIMPLE_REFS :: In former versions of the Swagger specification, reference strings were
allowed to take a simple form like `Pet`. These would be treated as internal references based on the
context in which the reference appears. For example, in old pet-store examples, references to the
`Pet` schema appeared simply as `$ref: Pet` and this would be equivalent to `$ref:
#/definitions/Pet`.
+
While these "`simple references`" are no longer supported by the Swagger specification, they are
still processed by some existing tools. Enabling this option will cause the normalizer to rewrite
simple references to fully compliant internal references.footnote:[Simple reference strings are
recognized only if they start with an alphabetic character or "`\_`" and consist solely of
alpha-numeric characters and "`_`".]
+
The REWRITE_SIMPLE_REFS option value should be either _true_ or _false_.

CREATE_DEF_TITLES :: This option causes the normalizer to add `title` properties to definitions that
do not already have them. The title for such a definition is set to its property name in the
`definitions` object of its containing Swagger spec.
+
TIP: This is particularly helpful when name collisions occur during localization, as the titles then
reflect the original names of the definitions, prior to renaming.
+
The CREATE_DEF_TITLES option value should be either _true_ or _false_.

INSTANTIATE_NULL_COLLECTIONS :: There are many optional properties in the Swagger specification, and
the Swagger Java parser creates structures in which omitted properties generally appear with `null`
values. This forces a great deal of null-checking in Java code that processes parsed Swagger
specs. The *INSTANTIATE_NULL_COLLECTIONS* option causes such null values for either array-valued or
object-valued properties to be replaced with empty arrays and objects, respectively, where doing so
would not alter the meaning of the spec.footnote:[An example of where such replacement would change
the spec is the `consumes` and `produces` arrays in operation definitions. For these, an empty array
would prevent inheriting the corresponding global defaults, while a null value would not.]
+
The INSTANTIATE_NULL_COLLECTIONS option value should be either _true_ or _false_.

FIX_MISSING_TYPES :: The Swagger Java parser accepts Swagger specs in which some object schemas are
missing their `type` property. This is allowed when the schema contains either a `properties` or
`additionalProperties` property, and the parser treats the schema as if it contained `type:
object`. This option causes the normalizer to explicitly add `type: object` in these schemas.
+
The FIX_MISSING_TYPES option value should be either _true_ or _false_.

ORDERING :: This option gives you some control over the order in which objects appear in the model
spec produced by the normalizer. Permitted values include:

* *AS_DECLARED*, meaning that there should be no reordering of the model elements by
   Normalizer. This applies only to objects declared in the top-level and other root files; objects
   localized or retained from other files will appear after all root file objects, but not in a
   predictable order.

* *SORTED*, meaning that a mostly-alphabetical ordering is imposed within the output model. In this
   case, all objects from all files participate, not just those from root files. The details of this
   ordering are as follows:

** Paths, global parameters, global responses, and schema definitions are all ordered in a
   quasi-alphabetic order based on their names in the normalized spec. This is a case-insensitive
   ordering, except that names of the form **Xxx_****__nnn__** are treated specially, where _nnn_ is
   a numeric suffix. Such names are typically the result of disambiguation when collisions occur
   through localization. However, if your models use such names on their own, they will be treated
   the same way by the ordering algorithm.
+
When such names occur, ordering is such that all names with the same root - including the unadorned
root itself - appear together, and with numerically increasing suffixes. This is the case even when
two roots differ only by letter case.
+
For example, you would always see the following names in the indicated order:
+
`FOO, FOO_1, FOO_2, ..., FOO_10, Foo, Foo_1, Foo_2, ..., Foo_10`

** Operations within a path are ordered in the standard sequence defined by the Swagger project's
   `Swagger` class: `get, head, post, put, delete, options, patch`

** Responses defined within an operation are sorted numerically by response code, with a `default`
   entry, if any, following all numeric entries.

With both treatments - even *SORTED* - ordering is restricted to the model contents specifically
mentioned above. So, for example, tags, operation parameters, object schema property lists, and the
top-level structure of the swagger spec should mostly be as they are in the source spec under both
ordering treatments, except where Swagger project software may disrupt things (e.g. in the ordering
of top-level model sections).

The way to interpret the above paragraph in the case of *AS_DECLARED* ordering is that the
Normalizer will not record positional information for items not explicitly mentioned in the details
of the *SORTED* ordering. Therefore, if these items are reorganized by Swagger software, it will not
be possible to reconstruct the original ordering.

In some cases these unaddressed orderings are likely to become addressed by the normalizer in a
future release, but we have explicitly chosen _not_ to reorder parameter lists in operations, since
doing so could cause incompatible changes in the output of certain code generators (e.g. in
generated method signatures).

=== Option Defaults

The normalizer is used in {RAS} in the following scenarios:

* Loading an OpenAPI spec for display in one of the _live views_: Diagram, Documentation, and
  Swagger UI.

* Loading an OpenAPI spec for processing by a GenTemplate other than the "KaiZen OpenAPI Normalizer
  [YAML+JSON]" GenTemplate.

* Loading an OpenAPI spec for processing by the "KaiZen OpenAPI Normalizer [YAML+JSON]" GenTemplate.

The following table specifies the option settings that are used in each case:

|===
| Option | Documentation Live View | All Other Scenarios 

| INLINE | PARAMETER, RESPONSE| PARAMETER, RESPONSE 
| RETAIN | PATH_OR_COMPONENT | ALL
| RETENTION_SCOPE | ROOTS | ROOTS
| ADDITIONAL_FILES | _empty_ | _empty_
| HOIST | ALL | ALL
| REWRITE_SIMPLE_REFS | _true_ | _true_
| CREATE_DEF_TITLES | _true_ | _false_
| INSTANTIATE_NULL_COLLECTIONS | _true_ | _true_
| FIX_MISSING_TYPES | _true_ | _true_
| ORDERING | AS_DECLARED | AS_DECLARED
|===

Note that the Document Live View defaults differ from all the rest, including other live views.

There is currently no way to alter the option settings for any scenario except the "KaiZen OpenAPI
Normalizer [YAML+JSON]" GenTemplate, where the GenTarget file explicitly sets all option values. The
New GenTarget wizard in {RAS} creates a GenTarget with option values set initially according to the
"All Other Scenarios" column above, and you may edit those options as desired.
